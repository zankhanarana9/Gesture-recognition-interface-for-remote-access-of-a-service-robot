# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-CNN
Hand Gesture Recognition using Convolution Neural Networks
Datacollection.py is used for collecting train data and test data. 
It takes 1000 images of each gestures and stores them as training set

The CNN model is trained and saved by using Traingest.py
Meta and index file are created which are used in predictgest.py

Predictgest.py is used for real time prediction of the gestures.
There are a total of 10 Different Gestures that are trained.
You can see the different gestures in Training set.
The Gestures corresponds to numbers 0-9.
